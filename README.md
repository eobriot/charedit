CHAREDIT, a C64 Tool
====================

What it is
----------

*A bit rough.*

This is a little tool I wrote to teach myself c64 assembly.
It helps designind characters by showing you the numeric value for
a pattern you are drawing at the screen.

What it will be, some day, maybe
--------------------------------

If I am feeling courageous, it could become a full character editor (allowing
you	to save and load your characters).

How to use it
-------------

I didn't write the basic launcher, so you have to sys 49152 to launch charedit.
Move around with cursor keys, plot/unplot with space.
You can quit by pressing "q".
